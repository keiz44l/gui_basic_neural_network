# gui_basic_neural_network
 Graphical interface with graphical view of the error of a basic neural network
 </br>Thanks to https://github.com/omaraflak, the base code of this project is from his course.
 </br>Here are the possible changes you can make to see the influence of some parameters :
 </br><ul>
   <li>alpha</li>
   <li>epochs</li>
   <li>alpha</li>
   <li>activation function</li>
   <li>loss function</li>
   <li>example to try (for now only xor)</li>
 </ul>
The requirements to run the project are python3, numpy, matplotlib and tkinter. To launch it, go into the directory <code>gui_basic_neural_network</code> and run the command : <code>./menu.py</code>
